Figure ~\ref{fig:oldsicsa} is the home page of SICSA. It provides a set of sample queries categorised in 4 different categories on the right of the 
search panel. The top panel shows links to differnet SICSA pages. The middle panel is the search panel. It is independent of other panels. 
Experts (results) with respect to a query are independently shown in this panel without reloading other panels. Figure~\ref{fig:resultspage} shows
the interface when experts with respect to a query, ``information retrieval'' are shown. Also, the system demonstrates 
faceted search for academics by presenting refinement options using university, location and total publication range categories.
Below the refinement options is popular tags (terms) appear in expert's profiles retrieved.
Each result in the search panel includes expert's details: university, number of publications, publication period and total number of coauthors.

Figure~\ref{fig:profilepage} illustrates a profile page of an expert. This page introduces most collaborated coauthors facet on the right of the page, a 
facet that shows popular terms appearing in an expert's profile and publications and related academics facet.

\subsubsection{Proposals}\label{section:goodexpert}
In section~\ref{sec:presentingQueryResult}, it was obvious that some evidence could be used to convince users how reliable a document (link) is.
In this secion, the evidence within
the context of this project will be discussed. As discussed in ~\ref{section:aims}, this project makes use of publications and funded projects as 
expertise evidence. Based on these evidence, what makes an expert a good expert? Well, it is common sense to propose that an expert is professional if 
\begin{itemize}
 \item he has published a lot of publications.
 \item he has co-authored with a lot of other experts in publications.
 \item he has co-authored with a lot of other experts in funded projects.
 \item he has received a lot of funding.
 \item he has involved in a lot of projects.
\end{itemize}

It can be seen clearly that these assumptions or features in learning to rank are independent on the query a user submits. These features are query independent
(section ~\ref{section:queryindependent}). However, query dependent features (section~\ref{section:querydependent}) should take into account as well. 
In this project, there are 2 query dependent features: funded project and publication features. To sum up, a good expert should have high scores in
both query dependent and independent features.

\subsubsection{Requirements Specification}
Due to the scope of the project it would be impossible to start without a clear vision of how
the end product should function. These requirements were decided on during the early stages of the project. 
The reasoning behind them comes primarily from a number of sources:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Research into a previous attempt at old SICSA system (section~\ref{sec:currentsystem}).
 \item Research into presenting query results (section~\ref{sec:presentingQueryResult}).
 \item Research into learning to rank techniques to enhancing the performance of the retrieval system by integrating different kinds of 
 expertise evidence (section~\ref{sec:letor}.
 \item Discussion with Dr. Craig Macdonald.
\end{itemize}
% However, developing an IR system is researched based. Utilizing learning to rank technique might not 
% produce optimal ranking due to the lack of training dataset. Therefore, 
The requirements have been split into 2 sections: functional requirements and non-functional requirements
several sections depending on their necessity.

\paragraph{Functional Requirements}
\subsubsection{Must Have}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Extracting funded projects from different 2 sources: Grant on the Web~\cite{gow} and Research Councils UK~\cite{gtr}.
 \item Integrating publications and funded projects as expertise evidence.
 \item Utilizing learning to rank techniques with an attempt to enhance the performance of the retrieval system.
 %\item Indexing and Retrieving documents (experts) effectively.
 \item Able to conclude that applying learning to rank techniques helps improve the performance of the retrieval system using evaluation matrices discussed
 in section~\ref{sec:evaluation}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Should Have}
\begin{itemize}
 \item providing refinement options for users to filter results by funded projects, publications and both.
 \item providing refinement options for users to filter funded projects and publications of each expert.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Could Have}
\begin{itemize}
 \item not yet
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Would Like to Have}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Ability to upload funded projects manually by member of the system.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Non-functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Functional 24 hours a day.
 \item Update data regularly.
 \item Able to load all evidence into main memory for efficient lookup.
 \item Fully functional for the purpose of the final demonstration.
\end{itemize}
